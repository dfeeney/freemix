Freemix Base README for versions > 1.2

For UNIX-like systems, including Mac OS X and Linux:

Requires:
* Python 2.6.x
* virtualenv 1.4.3+ (easy_install2.6 virtualenv)

To build:
> virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute freemix
> cd freemix
> source bin/activate
> pip install -e hg+http://foundry.zepheira.com/hg/freemix#egg=freemix
> pip install -r src/freemix/requirements/develop.txt

To create the database:
> cd src/freemix/freemix/
> ./manage.py syncdb --noinput
> ./manage.py migrate
> ./manage.py createsuperuser

To run the server on port 8000
> ./manage.py runserver_plus

The following should be run at a regular interval:
> ./manage.py send_mail



For Windows:

Download and run the latest Python 2.6 installer from
    http://www.python.org/download/

Download and run the latest setuptools installer from
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files

Download and run the latest Mercurial and TortoiseHg installer from
    http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/download/index.html

Download and run the latest MinGW installer from
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
The most user-friendly download is labelled "Automated MinGW Installer".
Make sure to select both g++ and MinGW Make from the options.

Some packages will require C/C++ compilation, which is what MinGW is for.
In your Windows home directory, create a file called pydistutils.cfg and
save it with the contents:

[build]
compiler=mingw32

Set PYTHON_PATH to C:\Python26\ (or wherever you choose to install it),
and add ";%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts\;C:\MinGW\bin\" to the Windows PATH
variable (again depending on where you installed MinGW).

You should now be able to open up the DOS Prompt and run gcc and
easy_install from the command line (getting normal errors about arguments
as opposed to unknown commands).

At the prompt, run:
> easy_install virtualenv
> virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute freemix
> cd freemix/Scripts
> activate.bat
> cd ..
> pip install -e hg+http://foundry.zepheira.com/hg/freemix#egg=freemix
> pip install -r src/freemix/requirements/develop.txt

DJANGO-COMPRESS
django-compress 1.0.1 contains a DOS-unfriendly filename in it that wil
cause installation to fail.  If this happens, remove django-compress from
develop.txt and the rest of installation should carry through without
incident.

After it concludes, run:
> pip install -i http://ryanlee.org/pip/ django-compress
to acquire a repaired django-compress installation.

To create the database:
> cd src/freemix/freemix/
> python manage.py syncdb --noinput
> python manage.py migrate
> python manage.py createsuperuser

You may get notice of pywin32 not being installed.  This won't get
in the way of functioning.  It is difficult to overcome as pywin32
is not currently available in a form easily compatiable with
virtualenv.

To run the server on port 8000
> python manage.py runserver_plus

The following should be run at a regular interval:
> python manage.py send_mail
